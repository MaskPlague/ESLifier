        Please briefly describe the issue you are experiencing. If the program is not patching an asset file correctly please detail what mod the file is from
        and what mod you're compacting the FormIDs for that should be causing the file to be patched. If a mod has errors in xEdit after compacting,
        please confirm that the issue doesn't exist on the pre-compacted version with the exact same mods loaded in xEdit before reporting it.
